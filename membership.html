            <h1>Membership</h1>
            <p>A seasonal membership provides access to our seven outdoor courts and the use of our online booking
                service; there are no initiation fees or court fees for members. We offer a variety of programming to
                enable new members to meet players of a similar playing level: Challenge Ladders, Drop In Doubles
                sessions, Tennis Socials, Group Lessons, and Club Tournaments. Our friendly staff will be happy to
                suggest playing partners, or simply add your name to a "Looking for a Hit" list. Players at every level
                are welcome.</p>
            <p>Members receive reduced rates for lessons and junior programs.</p>
            <p>The club officially opens on the last Saturday in April, but nets are often up earlier, weather
                permitting. The club's office closes on the Thanksgiving weekend but nets remain up until the snow
                arrives.</p>
